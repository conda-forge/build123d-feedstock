  summary: 'A python CAD programming library'
  description: |
    Build123d is a python-based, parametric, boundary representation (BREP)
    modeling framework for 2D and 3D CAD. It's built on the Open Cascade
    geometric kernel and allows for the creation of complex models using a
    simple and intuitive python syntax. Build123d can be used to create
    models for 3D printing, CNC machining, laser cutting, and other
    manufacturing processes. Models can be exported to a wide variety of
    popular CAD tools such as FreeCAD and SolidWorks.
